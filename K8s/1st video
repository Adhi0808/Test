Master Node and Worker node components
Master node setup - ec2 instance min 2GB 4core required.
   *install docker
   *k8s components
   in master node setup  we need engines to control worker nodes
   1- minikube
   2- kubeadm
   3- kops
        in above 3 engines we need only 1 engine to setup in master node to control worker nodes.
worker node 1
    *docker 
    *k8s worker node components
worker node 2
    *docker 
    *k8s worker node components

K8s setup for prctice with minimum requirements.
    Worker node :
        t2.medium with 2GB RAM 2-core cpu  required ubuntu server.
        commands: to install kubeadm follow the documents
Important : to create the worker nodes we can use the AMI of the master node which is a less tedious process.
 kubeadm init ----- used for making the instance master.
